Dustbin locator
Server Setup:
The Node.js server loads dustbin data from a JSON file and serves a web interface using Express.

Real-Time Updates:
The server uses Socket.IO to send dustbin data and updates (like fill level changes) to all connected clients in real time.

User Location:
The web app gets the user’s current location using the browser’s geolocation API.

Nearest Bin Calculation:
When the user’s location is sent to the server, the server calculates the nearest dustbin using the Haversine distance formula and sends this info back to the client.

Map Display:
The client displays all dustbins and the user’s location on a Leaflet map, updating markers and info dynamically.

Directions:
The app uses Leaflet Routing Machine to draw a route from the user’s location to the nearest dustbin.

Simulated Fill Levels:
The server periodically increases each bin’s fill level slowly, simulating usage, but never lets it exceed 90%.

Reset Functionality:
An API endpoint (/reset-bins) allows resetting all bins’ fill levels to zero, simulating collection.
